<p>My first draft and final product are the same, I was getting feedback on the project throughout so there was not a distinct review phase. The key thing that was brought forth was 
my background image was shifting position so I needed to make it be the same across each page. honestly I think the project could be better but it has been a bit of a rough semester.
I dont say that for sympathy, just want to make it clear that I enjoyed your class and I felt like I learned a great deal in it, I have just not been in the position where I could bring it all to bear.
Frankly I do not think this project deserves a good grade but I wanted to make sure I got something up and running, even if it kinda sucked. Regardless of my grade in the class it will be a positive experience 
for me.</p>

    P.S. Feel free to give me an A+++++++, I will not complain about it
