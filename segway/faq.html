<h2>CONCEPT CENTAUR</h2>
<p>
    Like the mythical half-horse, half-man of Greek lore, Concept Centaur combines the best of several technologies to create an innovative whole. The result of exploration by Segway Inc.'s product development team, Concept Centaur will challenge the way you think about four-wheeled transportation.
    From time to time Segway's product development team devotes days, or even weeks, to creating new product concepts with the goal of finding a prince among frogs. It's a product exploration process they call "frog kissing." During this time, engineers and designers are encouraged to use any available materials in a very short time frame to prove a concept will work.
    
    The product development team demonstrated that Concept Centaur was a prince—a concept that passed this initial feasibility test, but is not yet ready to become a product. Concept Centaur demonstrates Segway's continued commitment to breakthrough innovation and the innumerable possibilities for the future of personal transportation.

    <h3>WHAT IS THE CENTAUR?</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
    <li>How fast does it go?
    Concept Centaur prototypes have gone just over 20 miles per hour. If Concept Centaur were to be manufactured in the future, more testing would be required to determine the appropriate top speed.
    </li>
    <li> much does it cost?
    Since Concept Centaur is just that—a concept—they aren't for sale. At the present time, Segway Inc. has no plans to manufacture or sell this as a product. 
    </li>
    <li>When will it be available?
    At present time, Segway Inc. has no plans to manufacture the Centaur. All new Segway products will be posted to our website as they are released. If you'd like, you may send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:tswallace@ualr.edu" title="Email link">tswallace@ualr.edu</a> and include your name, address, and phone number to be notified of any additional information on Concept Centaur.
